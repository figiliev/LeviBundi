About me and coding 
Coding has always fascinated me,I spend hours lost in its world.My aunt had a computer that excited me growing up. 
Playing console games on Windows/DOS and wondering how it all came together.That,piqued my interest.
Professionally, automating processes that are manually challenging with Python(Robocorp) and Uipath software(c#.net).
Currently diving into the intricacies of webdevelopment in HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT with Techlahoma and C++ at UCO as I
take on my Computer Science classes.
