About me and coding 
Coding has always fascinated me,I spend hours lost in its world. Professionally, automating processes that are manually 
challenging with Python(Robocorp) and Uipath software(c#.net).
Currently diving into the intricacies of webdevelopment in HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT with Techlahoma and C++ at UCO as I
take on my Computer Science classes.
